# scrimbaPWGenerator


Reflection:

- First time really utilizing figma and do little bit more practice but that will come with more advanced projects and looking forward to it.
- Started fast with CSS but then started to slow down getting confused with the width and trying to get it responsivness at the same time and not have it static. Can't stand not seeing my webapps not be responsive and need practice but everything started to click and will come with the more projects that I do.
- After all my HTML and CSS was done it was my JS. Little rusty but understood the logic... when user clicks on generatePasswords() it would need to loop around the array as many times the user clicked on the button and use a Math.Random method but have an if statement where it pushes the result only after a set length is achived being 15 characters. Once that set length was achived I used the textContent method so it can show in the DOM and spit out the actual characters and not numbers by password1 += characters[charIndex1] and using the += operator since password1 was an empty string being my starting base.
- Still kind of confusing and still need a lot more practice as I feel like I spent more time doing CSS than JS and want to really keep practicing JS more.
